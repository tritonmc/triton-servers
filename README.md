# Triton Test Servers

This repo contains my test server configuration.
Unfortunately, it is not meant to be easily used by other users,
since many design decisions assume my current setup (e.g. Nix has to be used).

Additionally, the world files are not included in the git repository (yet?),
so it can't be used as is.
